ErlMUD
======

Evolutionary demonstration of Erlang/OTP development.

Stages
------

The stages of change are arbitrarily designated:
* Architecture
* Raw Erlang
* Pure Erlang
* Psychobitch
* OTP Release
* Improved OTP
* Cyclic maintenance

The above definitions are made up but are intended to be representative of the stages a project (or developer) may pass through. This project is accompanied by an in-depth commentary at http://zxq9.com/erlmud/.

The first stage has no code; it is an informal architectural discussion and specification in the commentary. All subsequent stages have both an independently functional codebase in a directory in the project root and a section in the commentary.

The commentary is written as a set of HTML pages stored within the root project directory in html/ and permanently hosted at http://zxq9.com/erlmud/.
